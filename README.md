# About this organisation 
 Hey , Everyone myself Ankit Sharma(Google developer group@Bit).

 As in our college their are lot of Clubs , but in a very disorganised way . So keeping that problem in my mind , we are creating a common platform where all the club lead can add the information about the events or any happening in their social club . 

 It has the functionality like you can see the member details, purchases the ticket for the event , can check out each and everything about the event and also the past incident . 
 All clubs lead and president have differnt login option where they have some diffenrent access about their clubs . 

 
 Future of this : 
 
 I will integrate this with my already made Bot where any new updates that are going in our college can be seen on the chat itself.
